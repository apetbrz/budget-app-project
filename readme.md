This is a personal budgeting web app to allow users to track their earnings, expenses, and savings. It consists of a custom multithreaded HTTP server implementation, serving raw HTML/CSS/JS, and performing app functionality entirely server-side.

### Usage

These instructions are subject to change, as the program is made more portable and standalone. For the time being, `cargo run` is recommanded for building + executing the current in-development version.

1. Install Rust, from `https://rustup.rs/`

2. In a shell, navigate into `server/` and run `cargo run`.
